      <title>Our Reasoning Behind the 3.13 Launch Delay</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2982929">Yesterday we announced</a> that we are delaying the release of 3.13 from December to January. While many players were supportive, some were disappointed and confused. We are also very disappointed in this outcome, but we see it as the only viable option. Today's post explains more detail about the process that led to this decision.

      <title>The Hallowed Grave and Dancing Skeleton Pet</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It's about time to decorate your hideout for Halloween! The new Hallowed Grave contains everything you'd expect from a Halloween decoration - glowing carved pumpkins, withered grass and skeletons. Those of you who prefer a good laugh instead of screaming for Halloween might be interested in a new Dancing Skeleton Pet. Its look and funny animations make the Dancing Skeleton a perfect companion for your Exile.

      <title>3.13 Launch Delayed until January</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We were previously targeting a launch date of December 11 for our 3.13 end-game expansion. As we <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2977334">discussed last week</a>, our new development methodology gives us confidence that we'd be able to hit this date with a high quality expansion. Yesterday, <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1321128432370176002">CD Projekt Red announced</a> that Cyberpunk 2077 will now be released on December 10. We do not want to put our players in a position of having to choose between these two games, so we have decided to step out of the way and delay the release of Path of Exile 3.13 until January.
